linc_ffmpeg_examples
=============

OpenFL demo of using linc_ffmpeg.

## Issues & drawbacks

* tested only on Windows (but should work on all major platforms)
* FPS drops on big resolutions (as we can't drill down to the SDL layer for _texture streaming_, we are passing video frames pixel by pixel)
* frequent setPixels/setPixel32 calls result in `version` variable overflow -- https://github.com/openfl/lime/blob/develop/src/lime/_internal/graphics/ImageDataUtil.hx#L1268 ðŸ˜¥

## To do

* workaround for bitmap drawing issue
